Your project flow in simple terms:

User Login → React app sends credentials to the Spring Boot backend.
Authentication → Backend verifies credentials and issues a JWT access token (short-lived) and a refresh token (long-lived).
API Access → React app includes the access token in requests for authentication.
Token Refresh → When the access token expires, the refresh token gets a new one without re-login.
Are you using Spring Security with JWT for this?



String , String Buffer and String Builder :
--------------------------------------------
String is immutable, StringBuffer is mutable and thread-safe (synchronized), 
while StringBuilder is mutable but not thread-safe (faster performance).


final , finally and finalized :
---------------------------------
final is a keyword for constants, method overriding prevention, and inheritance restriction; 
finally is a block in exception handling that always executes; 
finalize() is a method called by the garbage collector before object destruction.

final class and final method :
-------------------------------
A `final` class cannot be inherited, while a `final` method cannot be overridden by subclasses.


final in Threads:
------------------
In Java threads, final variables ensure thread safety by making variables immutable, preventing unintended modifications across multiple threads.


IOC:
-----
Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle where the control of object creation and dependency management.


What is Dependency Injection:
--------------------------------
This is a technique to implement IoC, where an object's dependencies are provided to it, 
typically via constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that provides an object's dependencies from external sources rather than creating them within the object, promoting loose coupling and easier maintainability.


Unique and Comsite Constatints in SQL :
-----------------------------------------
Constraints help enforce data integrity. Two important types are Unique Constraints and Composite Constraints:

1. Unique Constraint
Ensures that a column (or a set of columns) contains unique values across all rows.
It allows NULL values unless specified otherwise.

2. Composite Unique Constraint
Ensures uniqueness across multiple columns together.
The combination of values must be unique, but individual values can repeat.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
A functional interface has exactly one abstract method and can be used with lambda expressions, 
while a regular interface can have multiple abstract methods.







You said:

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
An abstract method is a method declared without a body in an abstract class or interface, meant to be implemented by subclasses.

You said:
Advantages of Streams
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Streams in Java allow concise and readable code, enable parallel processing, and provide efficient handling of large data sets with operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.






Lamda in java:
---------------
Lambda expressions in Java provide a concise way to represent anonymous functions or methods, enabling functional programming features.


Comparator and Compararing:
---------------------------
Comparator is an interface used to define custom sorting logic, 
while Comparable is an interface used to define the natural order of objects for sorting.


Class loader in java:
----------------------
A ClassLoader in Java is responsible for loading classes into the JVM at runtime, enabling dynamic class loading and managing the classpath.


API and Microservice:
------------------------
An API is a set of protocols for communication between software components, while a microservice is an architectural style where an application is broken into small, independently deployable services, each having its own API.


Solid Principles:
-----------------
The SOLID principles are five design principles aimed at making software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

S - Single Responsibility Principle
O - Open/Closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle


Circuit Breaker:
-------------------
A Circuit Breaker is a design pattern used to prevent system failure by detecting and isolating faults in a service or component, allowing it to recover gracefully.


Garbage collection:
--------------------
Garbage collection in Java is the automatic process of reclaiming memory by removing unused or unreachable objects from the heap.
