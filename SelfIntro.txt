**Self Introduction**

Hello, my name is Sathish Kumar Chittipothula, 
and I am a software developer with 2 years of experience.
I have done B.Tech with the specalizaion of E.C.E in 2018.

In my current role at Encora,
I specialize in web Developement using Java.

My technical expertise in Java,Spring Boot,Spring Security and SQL
I am particularly skilled in developing RESTful APIs using Spring Boot,
using version control systems like Git.

One of the key projects I worked on involved 340B Direct Health Care.
The 340B program in the US offers discounted drugs to individuals below the poverty line. 
Eligible participants receive 340B cards to access these discounts.
The program involves various entities such as covered entities, pharmacy groups, 
administrators, pharmacies, prescribers, and wholesalers. 
These entities must register with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), 
a department within the US healthcare system, to participate in the program.

This experience honed my abilities in problem-solving, collaboration with cross-functional teams, 
agile methodologies

I am passionate about continuous learning and always eager to explore new technologies 
and methodologies to enhance my skills.

Thank you for the opportunity.
