1. What is Java ?
	 Java is a high-level, object-oriented , platform-independent, Secure and Robust programming language.

2. Features of Java ?
	Platform Independence,Object-Oriented, Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection),
	Simple and Familiar Syntax,Robust and Secure,Multi-threading Support
	
3. What is Data Type ? What are they ?
	data type is a classification that defines the type of a value that can be stored in a variable.
	
	Two Types: 
	1. Primitive (8)
		byte,short,int,long,float,double,char,boolean
	2. Non-Primitive (reference)
		String,Array,Class,object,interface......

4. What is variable and Types of Variables?
 	variable is a container that holds/store data.
 	
 	Local Variables: These are declared within a method, constructor, 
 	or block of code and can only be accessed within that particular scope.

	Instance Variables (or Member Variables): These are declared within a class but outside any method,
	 constructor, or block. Each instance of the class (i.e., each object) 
	 has its own copy of these variables.

	Class Variables (or Static Variables): These are declared with the static keyword within
	 a class but outside any method, constructor, or block. 
	 Unlike instance variables, there's only one copy of a class variable per class,
	  shared by all instances of the class.
 	

5. Difference Between Encode and Encryption ?
	Encoding is used to convert data from one format to another.
		Base64 Encoding, URL Encoding ,Character Encoding
	Encryption is used to protect data by converting it into an unreadable format 
	that can only be reversed with the correct decryption key.
		Symmetric Encryption: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard).
		Asymmetric Encryption: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).
