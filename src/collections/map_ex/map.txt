In Java, the performance of different map implementations can vary depending 
on the specific use case and requirements. Here is a comparison of some common `Map` 
implementations in Java and their performance characteristics:

### 1. **HashMap**
- **Performance:** O(1) average time complexity for put, get, and remove operations.
- **Use Case:** Best for general-purpose use when fast lookups, inserts, and deletes are required.
- **Features:** Does not maintain any order of keys.

### 2. **LinkedHashMap**
- **Performance:** O(1) average time complexity for put, get, and remove operations.
- **Use Case:** When you need to maintain insertion order or access order while having fast lookups.
- **Features:** Maintains a doubly-linked list running through all its entries, 
	which maintains the order of insertion or access.

### 3. **TreeMap**
- **Performance:** O(log n) time complexity for put, get, and remove operations.
- **Use Case:** When you need to maintain a sorted order of keys.
- **Features:** Implements a Red-Black tree, so it naturally maintains a sorted order of its keys.

### 4. **ConcurrentHashMap**
- **Performance:** O(1) average time complexity for put, get, and remove operations 
	with good concurrency properties.
- **Use Case:** Best for concurrent applications where multiple threads might access the map simultaneously.
- **Features:** Thread-safe with high concurrency support.

### 5. **Hashtable**
- **Performance:** O(1) average time complexity for put, get, and remove operations.
- **Use Case:** Similar to `HashMap`, but thread-safe for single-threaded applications.
- **Features:** Synchronized, making it slower compared to `HashMap` due to overhead from synchronization.

### Summary:
- **Fastest for Single-threaded Use:** `HashMap` is generally the fastest for single-threaded 
	access where order does not matter.
- **Ordered Map:** `LinkedHashMap` provides fast access with the additional benefit of maintaining order.
- **Sorted Map:** `TreeMap` is the best choice if you need the keys to be sorted.
- **Concurrent Use:** `ConcurrentHashMap` is optimized for concurrent access and performs well 
	under multi-threaded scenarios.

In conclusion, if you are looking for the fastest map in a typical scenario without 
any specific requirements for ordering or sorting, `HashMap` is the best choice due to its O(1) 
average time complexity for basic operations. For concurrent access, prefer `ConcurrentHashMap`.


****************-----HashMap and HashTable------------***********************

The primary differences between `HashMap` and `Hashtable` in Java lie in their synchronization,
 null handling, and performance. Here's a detailed comparison:

| **Aspect**               | **HashMap**                                                                                               | **Hashtable**                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Synchronization**      | Not synchronized, making it **not thread-safe**.                                                        | Synchronized, making it **thread-safe** for single-threaded environments.                            |
| **Performance**          | Faster due to the lack of synchronization.                                                              | Slower because of synchronization overhead.                                                          |
| **Null Handling**        | Allows **one null key** and multiple **null values**.                                                   | Does **not allow null keys** or **null values**.                                                     |
| **Usage**                | Preferred for **non-thread-safe** environments or when external synchronization is used.                | Used in **thread-safe** environments, although `ConcurrentHashMap` is preferred in modern applications. |
| **Default Capacity**     | Default initial capacity is **16**, and the load factor is **0.75**.                                     | Default initial capacity is **11**, and it resizes by doubling its size + 1.                         |

### Key Takeaways:
- Use **HashMap** for better performance in **single-threaded** applications.
- Use **Hashtable** only if legacy code requires it, though in modern multithreaded applications, consider **ConcurrentHashMap** as a better alternative.
