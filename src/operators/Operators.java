 *		i. && - check 
 *
 *			 the "&&" operator is used as a logical AND
 *         operator. It returns true if both operands are true, and false
 *         otherwise. The expression using "&&" is only evaluated further if the
 *         first operand evaluates to true, otherwise it stops and returns false
 *         immediately.
 *         
 *      ii . || -
 *      
 *       the "||" operator is used as a logical OR operator. It returns true if either one of the operands is true, and false otherwise. The expression using "||" is only evaluated further if the first operand evaluates to false, otherwise it stops and returns true immediately.
