Memory management in Java involves a number of techniques to ensure 
efficient allocation and deallocation of memory, 
primarily through the use of an automatic garbage collection system. 

**Heap Memory**: 
	This is where all the objects are stored. 

**Stack Memory**: 
	This is used for execution of threads. 
	Each thread has its own stack, 
	which stores local variables, method calls, and partial results.

### **Garbage Collection (GC)**
Java manages memory using an automatic garbage collector 
which periodically checks for and frees up memory that is no longer being used by the program.

### **Memory Leaks in Java**
Even though Java handles memory management automatically, 
memory leaks can still occur if objects are unintentionally referenced for longer than necessary, 
preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming memory.
